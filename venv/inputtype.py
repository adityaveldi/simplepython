# here we see how to know the class of the variable
# initialize the variable
#suppose the variable be dtype
dtype=21
#we use "type()" to know the class of the variable as shown below
print(type(dtype))
# in python everything is an object which may be mutable or immutable
dtype='welcome to github'
#here dtype reference variable of an immutable object therefore the content in the object remains same but the refrence variable
#dtype now pointing to the string object containing some data.
# so built in types like int,float,bool,str,tuple etc are the immutable objects
print(type(dtype))
